## About The Project

Queste is an advanced yet simple-to-use quest plugin for Minecraft servers, supporting Spigot and relevant forks.

The plugin was created from the fact that existing plugins are all complex to setup and use, difficult to configure, and don't have the features expected from a quest plugin.

## Getting Started

To contribute to Queste, follow the steps below. Contributions are welcome.

### Prerequisites

* [JDK 16](https://adoptium.net/)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
* [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/), if on windows.
